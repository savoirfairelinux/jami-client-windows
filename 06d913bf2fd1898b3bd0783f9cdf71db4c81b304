As discussed earlier today, we may need a similar system to emulate a PBX \"busy\" system. So it doesn\u0027t make a lot of sense to remove AutoAnswer/DoNotDistrub/Busy from LRC.\n\nThe old gerrit commit was less or more based on the idea we would drop yaml, but it\u0027s not going to happen anytime soon.",
