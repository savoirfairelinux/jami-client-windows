      "message": "This remain to be seen. It may still be in LRC but use some kind of configuration adaptors for additional properties.

So it doesn\u0027t make a lot of sense to remove AutoAnswer/DoNotDistrub/Busy from LRC.\n\nThe old gerrit commit was less or more based on the idea we would drop yaml, but it\u0027s not going to happen anytime soon.",
